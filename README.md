# Empirical mode decomposition in C#

I implemented an C# version of EMD because I did not find such work anywhere. 
The project requires Extreme.Numerics, which you can get from NuGet in visual studio. It needs this library for spline interpolation. 
I have tested it on some simulated signals and some signals I obtained from sensors. But it is not fully tested.
